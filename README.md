<h1 align="center">RoA Replay Reader</h1>

Parses a `.roa` replay file to display its more relevant contents with a simple drag n' drop. Website can be found [here](https://readek.github.io/RoA-Replay-Reader/).

This should work for any kind of replay. If something is not right, please write an [issue](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Replay-Reader/issues) about it!

This project was made as an excuse for me to learn and use React for the first time. Github page was done with the help of [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

Most parts of the file parser were done thanks to [this documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qGwqXhZXxmAzcsilrkXvHqWEc55gQoMAeGVLWRdy_ak/edit#).
